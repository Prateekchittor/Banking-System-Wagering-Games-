Banking System with Wagering Games (C++ OOP Project)
🧑‍💻 Tech Stack: C++ | Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)

📅 Project Date: June 2024

🚀 Overview

This project implements a Banking System with integrated Wagering Games, built entirely using C++ Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as classes, inheritance, and virtual functions.
It provides account management functionalities and multiple interactive mini-games where users can wager and manage their virtual balance.

🧩 Features
🏦 Banking System

Create, view, and manage multiple user accounts

Deposit and withdraw money

Check balance and transaction history

Wager game earnings directly linked to your bank account

🎮 Wagering Games

🕹️ Tic-Tac-Toe – Classic 2-player or AI-based mode

🎲 Snake & Ladder – Randomized board play

💣 Minesweeper – Logic-based game with adjustable grid sizes

🃏 Card Game – Simple draw-based card match

⚅ Dice Game – Bet-based dice rolling with probability outcomes

🧠 Object-Oriented Concepts Used

Classes & Objects – For modular structure (BankAccount, Game, Player, etc.)

Inheritance – Common game base class extended by specific games

Polymorphism / Virtual Functions – For runtime game selection and execution

Encapsulation – Secure handling of account and game data

File Handling – To store and retrieve user details and account balance
